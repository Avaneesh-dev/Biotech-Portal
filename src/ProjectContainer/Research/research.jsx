            Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an all India
            examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of
            the candidates in various undergraduate subjects in Engineering/
            Technology/ Architeture and post-graduate level subjects in Science.
            The GATE score of a candidate reflects a relative performance level
            in a particular subject in the examination across several years. The
            score is used for admissions to post-graduate programs (e.g., M. E.,
            M. Tech and direct Ph.D.) in centrally funded Indian institutes of
            higher education (i.e., institutes which are provided with financial
            assistance by MHRD and other Government agencies). The score is also
            used by some Public and Private Sector Undertakings for employment
            processes. Direct recruitment to Group A level posts i.e., Senior
            Field Office (SFO Tele), Senior Research Officer (SRO) (Crypto) and
            Cabinet Secretariat is now being done on the basis of GATE scores.
            The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and seven Indian Institutes
            of Technology (11Ts at Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur,
            Madras and Roorkee) jointly administer the conduct of GATE. The
            operations related to GATE in each of the 8 zones are managed by a
            zonal GATE Office at the IITs or IISc.

            Since the syllabus for the GATE Biotechnology exam is very lengthy
            and broad, it is not wise to start preparing each and every topic.
            After researching the past trends, I have compiled a list of very
            important topics for the exam. Preparing these topics completely is
            more than enough to crack the exam.

            Most of the above mentioned topics are available in the pathfinder life sciences books. But the topics relating to Bioprocess Engineering must be prepared from other sources. When I was preparing for GATE Exam, what i did for bioprocess engineering part was to solve all the previous year questions of bioprocess engineering and made notes of all the formulas used in solving them.
          </h6>
          <h6 className="textpad">
            After you have prepared the important topics, you must start practicing general aptitude questions from any GATE aptitude book (most preffered ones are from publishers Arihant and pathfinder). Scoring high marks in aptitude is very important.
          </h6>
          <h6 className="textpad">
            Now that finally you have prepared both the important topics and worked hard on your aptitude problem solving, it is time to start solving previous year question papers. Make notes of all the questions that you are not able to solve correctly, this is very important and will come in handy during the 2 or 3 times revision phase.
          </h6>
          <h6 className="textpad">
            Revise your notes and stay calm before the exam! Your preparation is complete.
